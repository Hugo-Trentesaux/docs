# Quickstart

## Installing the CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 0.25.0
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Creating a project

Projects typically represent a single `Dockerfile` or repository.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Project` button
3. Enter a project name
4. Choose your connection type, `Depot Hosted` or [`Self-Hosted`](/docs/self-hosted/overview)
5. Click `Create Project`

## Running a local build

1. Run `depot login` to authenticate with your Depot account
2. `cd` to your project directory
3. Run `depot init` to link the local directory with a Depot project - this will create a `depot.json` file in the current directory
4. Run `depot build -t repo/image:tag .`

## Running a build in CI

1. `cd` to your project directory
2. Run `depot init` to link the local directory with a Depot project - this will create a `depot.json` file in the current directory
3. Commit your `depot.json` file to your repository
4. [Create a Depot project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens)
5. Configure your CI provider to use your project token
   - For GitHub Actions, [create an encrypted secret for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
   - For Google Cloud Build, [configure secrets from Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets)
   - For CircleCI, [configure an environment variable from your project settings](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project)
   - For Travis CI, [configure an environment variable from your repository settings](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#defining-variables-in-repository-settings)
6. Update your CI workflow to set the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable to your project token

```yaml
env:
  DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
```

7. Update your CI workflow to `depot build` instead of `docker build`.

```diff
- run: docker build -t ...
+ run: depot build -t ...
```
