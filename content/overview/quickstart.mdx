# Quickstart

## Installing the CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 0.25.0
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Creating a project

Projects typically represent a single `Dockerfile` or repository.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Project` button
3. Enter a project name
4. Choose your connection type, `Depot Hosted` or [`Self-Hosted`](/docs/self-hosted/overview)
5. Click `Create Project`

## Running a local build

1. Run `depot login` to authenticate with your Depot account
2. `cd` to your project directory
3. Run `depot init` to link the local directory with a Depot project - this will create a `depot.json` file in the current directory

### Option 1: use `depot build`

Once you've initialized your project, you can run `depot build` to build your Docker image. The [`build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) takes all of the same parameters as your normal `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

### Option 2: use `docker build`

Once you've initialized your projects and installed the `depot` CLI, you can run a one time configuration command to configure Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI and for `buildx`.

```shell
depot configure-docker --shim-buildx
```

This command installs `depot` as a plugin for the Docker CLI and makes Depot the default builder for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`.

Once you have ran that command, you can run `docker build` as you normally would and the build will happen on Depot.

```shell
docker build -t repo/image:tag .
```

## Running a build in CI

Integrating Depot into your CI workflow is a very similar process. Depot works with any CI provider, you can find guides for our most popular providers below.
