## Installing the CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 0.25.0
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Creating an organization

Organizations are the top level entity in Depot. They typically represent a single company or team. Billing details are attached to an organization.

1. Login to your Depot account to get to your [list of organizations](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Organization` button
3. Enter an organization name
4. Click `Create Organization`
5. Select the `Pay-as-you-Go` plan and click `Configure Billing`

**Note: You will be redirected to our Stripe checkout portal where you can enter your billing information.**

6. Enter your billing information and click `Subscribe`
7. You will be redirected back to Depot and your organization will be created

## Creating a project

Projects typically represent a single `Dockerfile` or repository.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Project` button
3. Enter a project name
4. Choose your connection type, `Depot Hosted` or [`Self-Hosted`](/docs/self-hosted/overview)
5. Click `Create Project`

## Running a local build

1. Run `depot login` to authenticate with your Depot account
2. `cd` to your project directory
3. Run `depot init` to link the local directory with a Depot project - this will create a `depot.json` file in the current directory

### Option 1: use `depot build`

Once you've initialized your project, you can run `depot build` to build your Docker image. The [`build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) takes all of the same parameters as your normal `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

### Option 2: use `docker build`

Once you've initialized your projects and installed the `depot` CLI, you can run a one time configuration command to configure Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI and for `buildx`.

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

This command installs `depot` as a plugin for the Docker CLI and makes Depot the default builder for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`.

Once you have ran that command, you can run `docker build` as you normally would and the build will happen on Depot.

```shell
docker build -t repo/image:tag .
```

## Running a build in CI

Integrating Depot into your CI workflow is a very similar process. Depot works with any CI provider, you can find guides for our most popular providers below.

- [Bitbucket Pipelines](../integrations/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Buildkite](../integrations/buildkite)
- [CircleCI](../integrations/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](../integrations/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](../integrations/gitlab-ci)
- [Google Cloud Build](../integrations/google-cloud-build)
- [Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins)
- [Travis CI](../integrations/travis-ci)

## Adding a build minute usage cap

By default, an organization is allowed to use unlimited build minutes in a month. However, you can configure a usage cap on your organization to avoid runaway costs.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs) and select your organization
2. Click on the `Settings` button
3. Under the `Usage caps` section you can choose between two options:

- **Unlimited**: By default organizations are configured to use unlimited build minutes in a month
- **Limit build minutes**: You can enter a fixed number of build minutes that your organization is allowed to use in a month. Once the limit is reached, builds will fail to start until the limit is raised or reset.
