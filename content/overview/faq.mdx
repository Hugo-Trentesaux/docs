# Frequently Asked Questions

### How many builds can a project run concurrently?

You can run as many builds concurrently as you want against a single Depot project.

### How do I use Depot with `docker-compose`?

You can use [`depot bake -f docker-compose.yml`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-bake) to build all of the images in your Compose file and then use `docker-compose up` to run the resulting images.

### How do you authenticate with Depot?

We have all our authentication options documented for `depot` in our [CLI authentication documentation](/docs/cli/authentication).

### Can I build Docker images for M1 Macs?

Yes! Depot supports native Arm container builds out of the box. We detect the architecture of the machine requesting a build via `depot build`. If that architecture is Arm, we route the build to a builder running Arm natively. You can build Docker images for M1 Macs and run the resulting image immediately, as it is made specifically for your architecture. See our documentation on [Arm containers](guides/arm-containers) for more details.

### Can I build multi-platform Docker images?

Yes! Check out our [integration guide](guides/arm-containers#what-about-multi-architecture-containers) on how we do it.
