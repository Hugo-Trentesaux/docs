# Frequently Asked Questions

### How many builds can a project run concurrently?

You can run as many builds concurrently as you want against a single Depot project.

### How do I use Depot with `docker-compose`?

You can use [`depot bake -f docker-compose.yml`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-bake) to build all of the images in your Compose file and then use `docker-compose up` to run the resulting images.

### How do you authenticate with Depot?

We have all our authentication options documented for `depot` in our [CLI authentication documentation](/docs/cli/authentication).

### Can I build Docker images for M1 Macs?

Yes! Depot supports native Arm container builds out of the box. We detect the architecture of the machine requesting a build via `depot build`. If that architecture is Arm, we route the build to a builder running Arm natively. You can build Docker images for M1 Macs and run the resulting image immediately, as it is made specifically for your architecture. See our documentation on [Arm containers](guides/arm-containers) for more details.

### Can I build multi-platform Docker images?

Yes! Check out our [integration guide](guides/arm-containers#what-about-multi-architecture-containers) on how we do it.

### Can I use Depot with my existing `docker build` or `docker buildx build` commands?

Yes! We have a [`depot configure-docker`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-configure-docker) command that configures Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI and sets Depot as the default builder for both `docker build` and `docker buildx build`. See our [`docker build` guide](/docs/guides/docker-build) for more details.

### What are these extra files in my registry?

Registries like Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Google Container Registry (GCR) don't accurately display provenance information for a given image. Provenance is a set of metadata that describes how an image was built. This metadata is stored in the registry alongside the image. It's enabled by default in `docker build` and thus by default in `depot build` as well.

If you would like to clean up the clutter, you can run your build with `--provenance=false`:

```shell
depot build -t <your-registry> --push --provenance=false .
```

### Does Depot support building images in any lazy-pulling compatible format? e.g. estargz, nydus or others?

Depot supports building images in any lazy-pulling compatible format. You can build an estargz image by setting the `--output` flag at build time:

```shell
depot build \
    --output "type=image,name=repo/image:tag,push=true,compression=estargz,oci-mediatypes=true force-compression=true" \
    .
```

### Does Depot supporting building images with ztsd compression?

Depot supports building images with `zstd` compression, a popular compression format to help speed up the launching of containers in AWS Fargate and Kubernetes. You can build an image with zstd compression by setting the `--output` flag at build time:

```shell
depot build \
  --output type=image,name=$IMAGE_URI:$IMAGE_TAG,oci-mediatypes=true,compression=zstd,compression-level=3 force-compression=true,push=true \
  .
```
