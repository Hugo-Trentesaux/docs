# GitLab CI

## Authentication

For GitLab, you can use project or user access tokens for authenticating your build with Depot. We recommend using project tokens as they are scoped to the specific project and are owned by the organization.

### [Project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens)

A project access token can be injected into your GitLab job for `depot` CLI authentication via [CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) or [external secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/). Project tokens are tied to a specific project in your organization and not a user.

### [User access token](/docs/cli/authentication#user-access-tokens)

It is also possible to generate a user access token that can be injected into your GitLab job for `depot` CLI authentication via [CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) or [external secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/). User tokens are tied to a specific user and not a project. Therefore, it can be used to build all projects across all organizations the user can access.

## Configuration

To build a Docker image from GitLab, you must set the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI/CD settings for your repository. You can do this through the UI for your repository via [this documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html).

In addition, you must also install the `depot` CLI before you run `depot build`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
build-image:
  before_script:
    - curl https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
  script:
    - depot build .
  variables:
    DEPOT_TOKEN: $DEPOT_TOKEN
```

## Examples

### Build and push to GitLab registry

To build a Docker image from GitLab and push it to a registry, you have two options to choose from because of how GitLab CI/CD with Docker allows you to build Docker images.

#### Option 1: Use the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` variable

This example demonstrates how you can use the CI/CD variable `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` ([see these docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#determine-your-docker_auth_config-data)) to inject a [GitLab Deploy Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/) you have created that can read/write to the GitLab registry.

You then inject that file before the build, which allows `depot build . --push` to authenticate to your registry.

**Note:** This requires configuring an additional CI/CD variable, but it avoids using Docker-in-Docker.

```yaml
build-image:
  before_script:
    - curl https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
    - mkdir -p $HOME/.docker
    - echo $DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG > $HOME/.docker/config.json
  script:
    - depot build -t registry.gitlab.com/repo/image:tag . --push
  variables:
    DEPOT_TOKEN: $DEPOT_TOKEN
```

#### Option 2: Using Docker-in-Docker

This example demonstrates using the [Docker-in-Docker](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-executor) executor. This method allows you to install the `depot` CLI in the `before_script` block and use `docker login` to authenticate to whichever registry you use.

```yaml
image: docker:20.10.16
services:
  - docker:20.10.16-dind
variables:
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2376
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: '/certs'

build-image:
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache curl
    - curl https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
  script:
    - echo "$DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASS" | docker login registry.gitlab.com --username <your-username> --password-stdin
    - depot build --project <your-project-id> -t registry.gitlab.com/repo/image:tag . --push
  variables:
    DEPOT_TOKEN: $DEPOT_TOKEN
```
