# Setup and Usage

Here are the steps to set up and use self-hosted builders in Depot:

## Configure a cloud connection

A cloud connection represents a connection between your cloud account and your Depot organization. Depot only supports **AWS** for the connection type today.

1. Go to the Settings page for your organization
2. Create a new connection in the **Cloud Connections** section
   - Choose your cloud connection type (AWS)
   - Enter a connection name for quickly identifying the connection in the UI
   - Enter your AWS account ID (a number like `123456789012`)
   - Select the number of warm Intel and Arm machines to keep running at all times
     - _Note: If enabled, the machines will be running 24/7 to serve a build request with minimal cold start_
3. Save the generated connection token in a secure location (like a password manager) as it will not be shown again in the UI

## Provision self-hosted infrastructure with Terraform

Today the [required infrastructure](/docs/self-hosted/architecture) is provisioned via Terraform, and we provide a [`depot/connection/aws`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/depot/connection/aws/latest) Terraform module for that purpose.

See the [module README](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/depot/connection/aws/latest#depotconnectionaws) for more information on the available module inputs, but the basic usage is as follows:

```terraform
module "depot-connection" {
  source            = "depot/connection/aws"
  version           = "x.x.x" # see the module README for the latest version
  connection-id     = "xxxxxx"
  connection-token  = "xxxxxx"
  availability-zone = "us-east-1a"
}
```

The three required inputs are:

| Input               | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connection-id`     | The ID of the cloud connection, shown in the organization settings page |
| `connection-token`  | The cloud connection token, shown once when you create the connection   |
| `availability-zone` | The availability zone to use for the connection resources               |

**Important:** The `connection-token` is a secret value that should be provided via a variable or however you prefer to manage Terraform secrets:

```terraform
module "depot-connection" {
  source            = "depot/connection/aws"
  version           = "x.x.x"

  ...
  connection-token  = var.connection-token
}
```

**Note:** Cloud connections run inside a single availability zone, for example, `us-east-1a`. If you need to run different projects in different availability zones, you can create a separate connection for each availability zone.

## Configure a Depot project to use self-hosted builders

After you have created a connection and provisioned the infrastructure, you can choose to use that new connection on a per-project basis if you are on a Enterprise plan.

You can update an existing project to use self-hosted builders by changing its connection type.

1. Go to the Settings page for your project
2. Under the **Connection,** select the one you would like to use
3. Save the changes

New projects can be configured to use self-hosted builders by selecting their connection type.

1. Click on the `Create Project` button
2. Enter a project name
3. Choose your new connection and click `Create Project`
