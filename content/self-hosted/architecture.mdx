Self-hosted Depot builders are built as a collaboration between the Depot CLI, Depot API, and infrastructure running inside your cloud account.

## Architecture

### Overview

Self-hosted builders allow the Depot API to provision, start, stop, and delete builder machines and cache volumes in your own cloud account. When the Depot CLI requests a build via `depot build` for a project using a self-hosted connection, the build flow is as follows:

1. The Depot CLI asks the Depot API for a new builder machine connection (with organization ID, project ID, and the required architecture) and polls the API for when the connection is ready
2. The Depot API stores that pending request for a builder
3. Periodically, a `cloud-agent` process running in your cloud reports current status to the Depot API and asks if there are any pending infrastructure changes â€” it receives a description of the machine to start for the pending build and launches that machine
4. When the machine launches, a `machine-agent` process running inside the VM registers itself with the Depot API and receives the instruction to launch BuildKit with specific mTLS certificates provisioned for your build
5. After the `machine-agent` reports that BuildKit is running, the Depot API returns a success response to the Depot CLI, along with new mTLS certificates to secure and authenticate the build connection
6. The Depot CLI uses the new mTLS certificates to directly connect the builder instance in your cloud account, using that machine and cache volume for the build

### Self-hosted Components

The self-hosted builder system uses several components, all of them open-source:

- [cloud-agent](https://github.com/depot/cloud-agent) runs as a Fargate task. This task is responsible for connecting to our Depot API via SSL and a connection token you receive when configuring your connection. It reports the current state of Depot infrastructure in your account, and receives back a list of actions that should be taken to update the Depot infrastructure to meet current build demands.

- [machine-agent](https://github.com/depot/machine-agent) is a process that runs on the build machines that are launched by the `cloud-agent`. This process reports to our Depot API to inform it that it is available for a build. Once assigned a build, it launches BuildKit to run the build and report its results back.

- [`depot/connection/aws`](https://github.com/depot/terraform-aws-connection) is a Terraform module that provisions the necessary AWS infrastructure and IAM permissions necessary for the cloud connection.

- The [machine images](https://github.com/depot/machine-images) (AMIs) that run inside your cloud are open-source as well.

- The [Depot CLI](https://github.com/depot/cli) supports directly connecting to builder machines in your cloud using mTLS.

## Security

There are a few key components to self-hosted builder security:

- **The hosted Depot service and API has no direct access to your cloud account,** instead the `cloud-agent` process translates the desired machine state into changes in your account. This means there are no cross-account IAM roles provisioned and no AWS access tokens stored in Depot's database. Additionally, the `cloud-agent` has a limited vocabulary of actions it can perform, limited to simple actions like creating, stopping, starting, and deleting builder machines.

- **The `cloud-agent` process has a restricted IAM role policy that only allows management of Depot infrastructure.** The [IAM policy](https://github.com/depot/terraform-aws-connection/blob/8554439eb10265337be8ed356224f1c28224f5f0/main.tf#L268-L361) provisioned by Terraform allows the `cloud-agent` to interact with EC2 instances and EBS volumes in your account, only if they are tagged with a `depot-connection` tag. Additionally, it requires that any new instances or volumes must be tagged with the `depot-connection` tag. This limits the radius of what the process is allowed to access, limiting it to only resources it has launched.

- **The Depot CLI communicates with self-hosted builder machines directly, using mTLS.** This means that your build data and communication are encrypted with TLS, authenticated for the build, and do not pass through any intermediary Depot-hosted proxy or API. This means your build data is private to your own AWS account. The mTLS certificates are provisioned per build machine / per build.

- **All software and machine images that run in your account are open-source.** This means that you can audit the codebase on GitHub for any agent process or AMI being launched within your account.
