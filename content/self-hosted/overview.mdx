# Self-Hosted Overview

Depot builds Docker containers on remote build machines â€” by default, those build machines run inside Depot's cloud, and you do not need to manage any infrastructure to use Depot.

However, with self-hosted Depot builders, you can choose to run your builds inside your own cloud account. Depot will manage the infrastructure for you, starting and stoping instances in response to builds, managing cache volumes, etc., using a suite of open-source agent processes.

Self-hosted builders use a connection that you configure inside your Depot organization with details about your cloud account (type, ID). You can then decide to use either Depot-hosted builder machines or your self-hosted cloud connection on a per-project basis.

## Why use self-hosted builders?

Self-hosted builders are great for organizations that want to run builds on their own infrastructure, inside their own cloud account. Depot fully manages the lifecycle of machines and volumes within your account, but you control that infrastructure and data at all times. The `depot` CLI communicates directly with the machines launched in your account, meaning your build data does not pass through Depot-managed infrastructure at all.

Self-hosted builders do require some additional setup work, so for organizations that do not need to run builds inside their own cloud, the default Depot-managed builders are a good choice.

## Supported Clouds

Depot self-hosted builders support the following clouds:

| Cloud            |     | Support     | Notes                                |
