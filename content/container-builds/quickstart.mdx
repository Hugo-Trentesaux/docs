Below is a guide to leveraging Depot for up to 40x faster container image builds with a literal drop-in replacement for `docker build`.

We also offer managed GitHub Actions Runners with 10x faster caching, you can get started with our runners in our [GitHub Actions Overview docs](/docs/github-actions/overview).

## Installing the CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 2.45.5
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Creating an organization

Organizations are the top level entity in Depot. They typically represent a single company or team. Billing details are attached to an organization.

1. Login to your Depot account to get to your [list of organizations](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Organization` button
3. Enter an organization name
4. Click `Create organization`

## Creating a project

A project is like a cache namespace. Any `Dockerfile` or `git` repositories you build within a project will share the same cache. When you have a service, Docker image, or repository that should be segregated, you should create a new project.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Project` button
3. Enter a project name
4. Choose the region for your project (i.e. where build data should be stored)
5. Select a cache storage policy (i.e. how much build cache to keep)
6. Click `Create Project`

**Note:** You can always change the region and cache storage policy for a project later.

## Running a local build

There are two options for running local builds with Depot. You can use our `depot build` command which is a drop-in replacement for your existing `docker build` command.

Once you've initialized your project, you can run `depot build` to build your Docker image. The [`build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) takes all of the same parameters as your normal `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

Your first `depot build` locally will ask you to authenticate with Depot and choose the project for your build. The CLI will prompt you to save this project in a `depot.json` file in your repository. This file is used to remember your project for future builds.

**Note: You can also specify a `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable instead of saving a `depot.json` file.**

#### Using Depot with your existing `docker build`

There is the option to configure your existing `docker build` commmands to leverage Depot behind the scenes for the build. This is done by configuring Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI. You can see our [`depot configure-docker` docs](/docs/cli/reference#depot-configure-docker) for more information.

## Running a build in CI

Integrating Depot into your CI workflow is a very similar process. Depot works with any CI provider, you can find guides for our most popular providers:

- [AWS CodeBuild](../integrations/aws-codebuild)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](../integrations/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Buildkite](../integrations/buildkite)
- [CircleCI](../integrations/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](../integrations/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](../integrations/gitlab-ci)
- [Google Cloud Build](../integrations/google-cloud-build)
- [Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins)
- [Travis CI](../integrations/travis-ci)

## Adding a build minute usage cap

By default, an organization is allowed to use unlimited build minutes in a month. However, you can configure a usage cap on your organization to avoid runaway costs.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs) and select your organization
2. Click on the `Settings` button
3. Under the `Usage caps` section you can choose between two options:

- **Unlimited**: By default organizations are configured to use unlimited build minutes in a month
- **Limit build minutes**: You can enter a fixed number of build minutes that your organization is allowed to use in a month. Once the limit is reached, builds will fail to start until the limit is raised or reset.
