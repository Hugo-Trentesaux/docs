# Authentication

**Note: Our API is currently in beta. If you are interested in using it to build images from your code, please [contact us via email](mailto:contact@depot.dev)**

You need to generate an API token to authenticate with the Depot API. API tokens are scoped to a single organization and grant access to manage namespaces and builds within your Depot organization.

## Generating an API token

You can generate an API token for an organization by going through the following steps:

1. Open your Organization Settings
2. Enter a description for your token under API Tokens
3. Click Create token

This token can create, update, and delete namespaces and run builds within your organization. You can revoke this token at any time by clicking `Remove API token` in the token submenu.
