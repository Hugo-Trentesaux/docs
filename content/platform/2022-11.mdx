### Changes

- **Upgraded default builder instance types.** We are now running `c6i.xlarge` instances for Intel builders and `c7g.xlarge` instances for Arm builders. We expect a 25% increase in build performance compared to the previous machine configuration.
- **Direct builder connections with mTLS.** The Depot CLI now connects directly to builder machines for `depot build`, using HTTPS and mTLS for authentication and encryption. This removes our previous reverse proxy and increases networking stability and performance.
- **Faster build start time with warm builders.** We now assign incoming builds to a machine from a warm builder pool. This greatly reduces the start time for new builds, for instance ARM builds now start in under 5 seconds, compared to as much as 30 seconds before. Builder machines are still single-tenant, and once assigned to a project are not used for any other projects or organizations.
- **Faster CLI connection to builders with quick connect.** When connecting to platform 2022-11, the Depot CLI version 1.2.0 and later uses a faster system for connecting to builders, 5x faster that the previous system.
