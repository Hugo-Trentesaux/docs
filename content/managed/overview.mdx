ogTitle: Overview of Depot Managed
description: Depot Managed allows you to deploy the Depot data plane in your own AWS account. This provides data residency, compliance, and cost control benefits.
---

With Depot Managed, the Depot data plane can be deployed in your own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. You can still use the Depot CLI, web application, and API, however the underlying build compute and cache data reside entirely within your own cloud account.

_We are considering support for additional cloud providers like Google Cloud (GCP) in the future. If you are interested in this, please [let us know](mailto:help@depot.dev)._

## How Depot Managed works

Depot Managed is the entirety of the Depot [data plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_plane#Data_plane), deployed in a single-tenant isolated sub-account within your AWS organization. Once deployed, you have the option of using Depot Managed with some or all of your Depot organization's projects. You will continue to use the same Depot CLI and web application, but the CLI will communicate directly with the compute and cache infrastructure running in your AWS account.

If you are an existing Depot user, moving to a Depot Managed deployment requires no changes to your existing developer workflows or CI pipelines.

Depot Managed is still a fully managed service and comes with the full support and SLA of the Depot Business plan. The Depot team is on-call for any issues that arise with the Depot Managed deployment.

## Benefits of Depot Managed

Depot Managed comes with a few key benefits:

- **Data residency**: All build data and cache data reside within your own cloud account, ensuring that you have full control over your data.
- **Compliance**: For organizations that have strict compliance requirements.
- **VPC peering & IAM**: You can configure VPC peering and IAM roles to allow the Depot data plane to access your private cloud resources.
- **AWS PrivateLink**: You can use AWS PrivateLink to keep all communication between the Depot data plane and control plane within the AWS network.
- **Cost control**: You can take advantage of any existing cloud discounts or credits you have, and you can control the size and type of instances used for builds.
- **AWS Marketplace**: You can pay for Depot Managed through the AWS Marketplace and take advantage of any existing AWS billing arrangements you have.
