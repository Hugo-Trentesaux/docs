# Depot Managed on AWS

With Depot Managed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Depot data plane is deployed within an isolated sub-account of your AWS organization. You can use the Depot CLI, web application, and API, but the underlying build compute and cache infrastructure reside entirely within your own AWS account.

## Architecture

## Setup and Usage

**NOTE:** This guide is intended for Depot customers who are working with the Depot team, you cannot deploy Depot Managed on AWS without it being enabled for your Depot organization. [Contact us](mailto:contact@depot.dev) if you are interested in using Depot Managed.

### Step 1: Create a dedicated sub-account

Depot Managed requires the use of a dedicated sub-account within your AWS organization. This should be a new account containing no other resources or services.

Follow the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-new) to create a new account within your organization.

### Step 2: CloudFormation stack deployment

Once you have created a new sub-account, you can deploy the following CloudFormation template to provision the required IAM permissions in the AWS sub-account. First, save the following as a file named `depot-managed-bootstrap.json`:

```json
{
  "Resources": {
    "GrantProvisionerAccess": {
      "Type": "AWS::IAM::Role",
      "DeletionPolicy": "Retain",
      "Properties": {
        "RoleName": "DepotProvisioner",
        "ManagedPolicyArns": ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"],
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                  "arn:aws:iam::375021575472:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWSReservedSSO_Provisioner_572dd0a52dd9fc8e"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "GrantOpsAccess": {
      "Type": "AWS::IAM::Role",
      "DeletionPolicy": "Retain",
      "Properties": {
        "RoleName": "DepotOps",
        "ManagedPolicyArns": ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"],
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                  "arn:aws:iam::375021575472:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/AWSReservedSSO_Ops_e45adfee11ab7421"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, deploy the CloudFormation stack in the new sub-account:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
 --stack-name depot-managed-bootstrap \
 --template-body file://depot-managed-bootstrap.json \
 --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### Step 3: Notify Depot

Finally, let the Depot team know that the CloudFormation stack has been deployed, and they will initiate the deployment of the Depot data plane into the new sub-account.

The Depot team will additionally work with you on any follow-up steps, including:

- AWS quota increases to match your expected usage
- Configuring KMS keys for encryption
- Configuring S3 buckets for cache storage
- Configuring VPC peering for private networking
- Configuring AWS PrivateLink for secure API access
- Enabling enforced usage of Depot Managed in your Depot organization
