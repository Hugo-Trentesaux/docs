# Ephemeral Registry

The **ephemeral registry** is a temporary registry for your Depot builds. It allows you to easily save your build, then pull it back later, without needing to push to another registry. Additionally you can choose to push your build directly from the ephemeral registry to your own registry.

Builds saved in the ephemeral registry are currently persisted for **7 days**, after which time they are deleted.

## Saving

To save a Depot build in the ephemeral registry, use the `--save` flag when running `depot build`:

```bash
depot build --save ...
```

If you are using GitHub Actions with the `depot/build-push-action`, you can add `save: true` as an input:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    save: true
```

**Note:** To pull the image back or push it to another registry, you will need the build ID. The build ID is printed in the output of `depot build` and is automatically set as an output of the `depot/build-push-action`:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  id: build
  with:
    save: true

- name: Print build ID
  run: echo ${{ steps.build.outputs.build-id }}
```

## Pulling

To pull a build that has been saved in the ephemeral registry, you can use the `depot pull` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot pull <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

You can also omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose for pulling.

Pulling images from the ephemeral registry is accelerated by Cloudflare for fast pull times.

## Pushing

To push a build that has been saved in the ephemeral registry to your own registry, you can use the `depot push` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot push <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

Some notes:

1. Like adding the `--push` flag to `depot build`, the `depot push` command uses registry credentials stored in Docker when pushing to registries. If you have not already authenticated with your registry, you should do so with `docker login` before running `depot push`.

2. Similar to `depot pull`, you can omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose from.

3. `depot push` will push the image to the target registry directly from the remote infrastructure, without downloading it to the CLI first, to avoid unnecessary data transfer.

## Example use-cases

- CI
- Large images
