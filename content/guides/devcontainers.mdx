# Dev Containers

## Why use Depot with Dev Containers?

[Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are becoming a popular way to leverage a container as a fully featured development environment directly integrated with Visual Studio Code. You can open any folder inside a container and use the full power of VS Code inside.

With Depot, you can build your Dev Containers on demand with instant shared caching across your entire team.

## How to use Depot with Dev Containers

### Create a project

This project represents the Dev Container you want to build and share across your team. You can create a project in Depot by following these steps:

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Project` button
3. Enter a project name
4. Choose your connection type, `Depot Hosted` or [`Self-Hosted`](/docs/self-hosted/overview)
5. Click `Create Project`

### Install and configure the `depot` CLI

You must install the [`depot` CLI](/docs/cli/installation) to configure your repository and Docker environment to leverage Depot builders.

Once the CLI is installed, you can configure your environment:

1. Run `depot login` to login to your Depot account
2. Change into the root of your project directory
3. Run `depot init` to link your project to your repository; this will create a `depot.json` directory in the current directory

_Note: Another option is to specify the Depot project ID with the environment variable `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` instead of running `depot init`_

### Configure Docker to use Depot

Dev Containers uses the `docker buildx build` command internally to build the container image. You can configure Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI and Buildx with the following command:

```bash
depot configure-docker --shim-buildx
```

The `configure-docker` command is a one-time operation that routes any `docker build` or `docker buildx build` commands to Depot builders.

### Build your Dev Container

There are multiple options for building your Dev Container:

1. You can open an existing folder in VS Code in a container, [see these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
2. You can open a Git repo or Pull Request in an isolated container, [see these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume)
3. You can also build your Dev container directly using the [`devcontainer` CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/devcontainer-cli#_prebuilding):

```bash
devcontainer build --workspace-folder .

```

You should see something similar to the above in your VS Code or `devcontainer` build logs. You can see that the `docker buildx build` command is called, and then you see log lines for `[depot] ...` that confirm your Docker image build is routed to Depot builders.
