# Private Registries

## How do I build container images that access private registries?

Our `depot` CLI uses your local Docker credentials provider. So, any registry you've logged into with `docker login` or similar will be available when running a Depot build. This means that you can build images that use private registries like the example below.

```Dockerfile
FROM my-private-registry/project/image:version
...
```

If you are experiencing issues with this, you should confirm you have logged into the registry from the machine where you are trying to run `depot build`. One way to ensure this is to try pulling the image via `docker pull my-private-registry/project/image:version`.
