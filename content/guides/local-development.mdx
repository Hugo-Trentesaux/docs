# Local Development

## Why use Depot for local development?

Replacing `docker build` with `depot build` allows you to get faster Docker image builds via Depot's remote builders and persistent caching. The cache is shared across your entire team who has access to a given Depot project, allowing you to reuse build results and cache across your entire team for faster local development. Additionally, routing the image build to remote builders frees your local machine's CPU and memory resources.

### Cache sharing with local builds

There is nothing additional you need to configure to share your build cache across your team for local builds. If your team members can access the Depot project, they will automatically share the same build cache. So, if you build an image locally, your team members can reuse the layers you built in their own builds.

## How to use Depot for local development

To leverage Depot locally, [install the `depot` CLI tool](/docs/cli/installation) locally and [configure your Depot project](https://depot.dev/docs/quickstart#creating-a-project), if you haven't already.

With those two things complete, you can then login to Depot via the CLI:

```bash
depot login
```

Once you're logged in, you can configure Depot inside of your git repository by running the `init` command:

```bash
depot init
```

The `init` command writes a `depot.json` file to the root of your repository with the Depot project ID that you selected. Alternatively, you can skip the `init` command if you'd like and use the `--project` flag on the `build` command to specify the project ID.

You can now run a build with Depot locally by running the `build` command:

```bash
depot build -t my-image:latest .
```

By default, Depot won't return you the built image locally. Instead, the built image and the layers produced will remain in the build cache. However, if you'd like to download the image locally, for instance, so you can `docker run` it, you can specify the `--load` flag:

```bash
depot build -t my-image:latest --load .
```

## Using Depot with Docker Compose

If you're using Docker Compose, you can configure your `docker-compose.yml` file just as you usually would. You can then build your images inside of a compose file via our `bake` command:

```bash
depot bake -f docker-compose.yml --load
```

The `bake` command concurrently builds all of the images defined in your compose file on a Depot builder with persistent caching. After the build, the `--load` flag will download the images locally. Once the build is complete, you can run your compose file as you usually would:

```bash
depot bake -f docker-compose.yml --load && docker compose up
```

The `bake` command effectively replaces `docker compose build` with `depot bake` and allows you to get significantly faster image builds while still being able to leverage Docker Compose.
