# Local Development

## What is local development with Depot?

When you run `depot build` locally, the build context gets transferred to a remote builder in Depot, where the image gets built.

The resulting image remains in the remote builder cache without specifying any other CLI options. If you would like to download the image locally, for instance, so you can `docker run` it, you can specify the `--load` flag: `depot build --load ...`.

Alternatively, if you would like to push the image to a registry, specify the `--push` flag: `depot build --push ...`.

## Why use Depot for local development?

Using Depot to run your image builds removes the need to run Docker locally and frees up your local CPU & memory resources. In addition, when using Depot, the Docker layer cache is shared across your team and CI systems with access to the project, allowing you to easily reuse build results and cache across your entire team for faster local development.
