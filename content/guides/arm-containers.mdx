# Arm Containers

## Why build native Arm containers with Depot?

Depot is a remote Docker build service that makes the image build process faster. When image builds are routed to Depot, we can speed up your build by making the cache persistent, shared, and more intelligent. Saving you build minutes and allowing your developers to reuse each other's work without any heavy lifting.

That is true for images that are built for x86 and Arm. Depot is one of the few managed services that can build true Arm containers that run on M1 MacBooks, AWS Graviton, and Azure Ampere. Giving you all the benefits of blazing-fast image builds with fast and intelligent caching,
but without any emulation.

## How to build native Arm containers with Depot

With `depot build`, we detect the architecture of the machine requesting the container image build. For example, if it is an x86 machine, we route the build to our x86 builder fleet and return you a compatible image.
If it is an Arm machine like M1 or AWS Graviton, we route the build to our Arm builder fleet and return you a compatible image.

## What about multi-platform/multi-architecture containers?

We are the only CI provider that allows you to build multi-platform images with zero emulation. So, for example, if you want to build a container image that is compatible with both x86 and Arm, you can use `depot build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`. We will build the image for you on both native Intel and native Arm builders in parallel, returning the combined image that is compatible with both architectures.

After building, you can specify `--push` to push the image directly to your registry. Mainstream registries like Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry, and Azure Container Registry support multi-platform images.

You can also specify `--load` to load the image back into your Docker daemon. Unlike other tools, `depot build` supports loading a multi-platform image back into the client daemon without having to push it to a registry first.
