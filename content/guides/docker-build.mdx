# Docker build

## How to use Depot with `docker build`

Depot can directly integrate with your existing `docker build` workflows via a one-time configuration command from our `depot` CLI. See [our instructions for installing our CLI](/docs/cli/installation) if you still need to do so.

With the CLI installed, you can run `configure-docker` to configure your Docker CLI to use Depot as the default handler for `docker build`:

```bash
depot configure-docker
```

## Running builds with Depot

To run builds with Depot via `docker`, you still need to connect the build to an active Depot project either via the `depot init` and `depot.json` file or via the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

Once your `docker` environment is configured to use Depot, you can run your builds as usual.

```bash
DEPOT_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id> docker build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```
