## Running builds with Depot

To run builds with Depot via `docker`, you still need to connect the build to an active Depot project via the `depot init` and `depot.json` files or via the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

## How to use Depot with Docker

Depot can directly integrate with your existing Docker workflows via a one-time configuration command from our `depot` CLI. See [our instructions for installing our CLI](/docs/cli/installation) if you still need to do so.

With the CLI installed, you can run `configure-docker` to configure your Docker CLI to use Depot as the default handler for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`:

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

Underneath the hood, the `configure-docker` command installs Depot as a Docker CLI plugin and sets the plugin as the default Docker builder (i.e., `docker build`). In addition, the command also installs a Depot `buildx` driver and sets that driver as the default driver for `docker buildx build`.

### `docker build`

Once your `docker` environment is configured to use Depot, you can run your builds as usual.

```shell
docker build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```

If you have correctly configured your Depot project via `depot init` or `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID`, your build will automatically be sent to Depot for execution. You can confirm this by looking for log lines in the output that are prefixed with `[depot]`.

### `docker buildx build`

Similarly, once your environment is configured to use Depot, you can run your `docker buildx build` commands as usual.

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```

Again, you can confirm that builds are going to your Depot project by looking for log lines that are prefixed with `[depot]` or by checking out the [builds for your project](/orgs).

## Using Depot with Docker Compose

Once the `configure-docker` command is executed, you can use Depot with Docker Compose without changing a single line of code. All you need to do is ensure you have a Depot project configured for your build. You can do this via:

1. Setting a `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to the project ID of the project you want to use for builds
2. Running `depot init` in the root of the repository in which you're building your image. The command creates a depot.json file that our plugin will detect.

Under the hood, `docker compose build` uses `docker buildx build` to build your images. As a result, you can use `docker compose build` as usual, and your builds will be sent to Depot.

```shell
docker compose build
```

Because of how Compose communicates with the `buildx` driver, there are a few things to be aware of:

1. Confirming the build went to Depot is best done by going to the [builds for your project](/orgs)
2. A new build will be created for each service + architecture defined in your `compose.yml` file. For example, if you have a `web` service and a `worker` service and are building for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, you will have four builds created in Depot.

If you prefer to use `docker compose up` that works as well. The `up` command will automatically build your images if not already built.

```shell
docker compose up
```
