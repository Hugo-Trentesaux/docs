description: Configure Depot to manage your GitHub Action runners for faster CI builds
---

Depot now supports managing GitHub Action runners for your organization. This allows you to run your CI builds on runners that are managed by Depot, which are faster and more reliable than the default GitHub runners at **half the cost**.

If you use Depot for faster Docker image builds, your BuildKit builder runs right next to your managed GitHub Action runner. Allowing for faster CI builds by mimizing network latency and data transfer.

## Step 1: Connect to GitHub

To configure Depot GitHub Action Runners, you will need to connect to your GitHub organization and install the Depot GitHub App. This can be done from the `GitHub Actions` tab in the Depot dashboard for your organization.

## Step 2: Configure your GitHub Actions workflow

Once installed, you can configure your GitHub Actions to use the Depot runners by specifying the `runs-on` key in your workflow file.

```diff
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
-    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
+    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04-16
    steps:
      ...
```

### Depot supported configurations

The `runs-on` label to leverage Depot runners is in the format `depot-<os>-<version>-<cpus>-<architecture>`. Below are the full list of supported configurations:
