# GitHub Actions Runners

Our fully-managed GitHub Actions Runners are a simple drop-in replacement for your existing runners in any GitHub Action jobs. Our runners have 30% faster compute, 10x faster caching and are half the cost of GitHub hosted runners.

Here are a few technical and implementation details that are relevant for Depot-managed GitHub Actions runners:

- **Single tenant**: Runners are single tenant, we run your job and then kill the machine, it's never reused
- **30% faster compute**: For Intel runners, we launched with 4th Gen AMD EPYC Genoa CPUs and for Arm runners, we launched with AWS Graviton2 CPUs
- **10x faster cache**: Runners automatically integrate with our distributed cache architecture for upload and download speeds up to 1000 MiB/s on 12.5 Gbps of network throughput â€” no 10GB cache limit either
- **Per second billing**: We track builds by the second and only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month and don't enforce a one minute minimum
- **No limits**: No concurrency limits, no cache size limits, and no network limits
- **Self-hostable**: We can run our optimized runners in our cloud or your AWS account for additional security and compliance

In addition, if you use Depot for faster Docker image builds via our [remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview), your BuildKit builder runs right next to your managed GitHub Action runner, allowing for faster CI builds by mimizing network latency and data transfer.

## Pricing

Depot managed GitHub Action Runners are available on [all of our pricing plans](/pricing). Each plan includes a bucket of both of Docker build minutes and GitHub Actions minutes. Business plan customers can [contact us](mailto:help@depot.dev) for custom plans.

|                                 | Developer | Startup                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Docker build minutes included   | 500       | 5,000 + $0.04/minute after   |
| GitHub Actions minutes included | 2,000     | 20,000 + $0.004/minute after |

Startup plans and above can pay for additional usage on a per minute basis for both Docker image builds and GitHub Actions minutes. For both types of minutes we charge on a per-minute basis, tracked per second. We only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month.

### Additional usage pricing for GitHub Actions minutes

Below is the per-minute price for each type of labeled runner for **Startup** and **Business** plans once they exhaust their bucket of included minutes.
